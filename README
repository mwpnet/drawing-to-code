Drawing to Code

Basic vector drawing program, that give you back the javascript code needed to 
recreate the image drawn. It's designed so that you can paste code in from 
elsewhere and edit it here.

There are some caveats when using this program:

    First and foremost this is still alpha code. So expect things to break.
    The code parsing that the program uses is very primitive and can be easily 
    	confused and break.
    Since the drawing part manipulates the arguments of the code itself, the 
    	path methods can only have literal numerical values. No variables.
    Currently the program does not handle transformations properly. It turns 
    	out this is exceptionally complicated, and will have to wait until the 
    	next version.



-- TODO --

-Change the code parsing part to something that actually parses code, instead of strings.
-Handle transformations.
-Make the html drawing page look nicer.
-Get a better name for the project.

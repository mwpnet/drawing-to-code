this is an outline of how I organize the various canvas properties and methods
The various tool selection parts are going to be based on this.
Note that I'm leaving out many canvas properties and methods, just so I can organize this better.

looking through these parts leads to a nice organizational properties:
-- drawing elements are a kind of "marker"
-- all styles between drawing elements can be reorder arbitrarily, as long as they stay between those elements
-- paths must be kept in order, can be mixed with styles (also text, and rectangles, but I'm ignoring that for simplicity)


	There are tree categories of styles
	
		color/gradient/shadow style (color+ for short)
			fillStyle
			strokeStyle
		
			createLinearGradient()
			createPattern()
			createRadialGradient()
			addColorStop()
			
			shadowColor
			shadowBlur
			shadowOffsetX
			shadowOffsetY
			
		line styles
			lineCap
			lineJoin
			lineWidth
			miterLimit
			
		text style
			font
			textAlign
			textBaseline
	
	There is one category of path parts
		parts
			beginPath()
			moveTo()
			closePath()
			lineTo()
			clip()
			quadraticCurveTo()
			bezierCurveTo()
			arc()
			arcTo()
			rect()
	
	There are three categories of drawing elements
		rectangles
			fillRect() - affected by color+
			strokeRect() - affected by color+ and line style
			clearRect() - none
	
		paths
			fill() - affected by color+  and paths
			stroke() - affected by color+, line style, and paths
			
		text
			fillText() - affected by color+, and text style
			strokeText() - affected by color+,  line style and text style
